# Resorts-Website1

Hi Everyone!

This is the 1st website that I did within a project called "6projects / 6days". 
The aim of this project is masterize HTML / CSS to start learning deeply JavaScript.
This project is composed by 6 projects made by myself with inspiration of other pages that I saw on the net.

This is my first page that I could made by myself. When I had some trouble, I used Google and adapted it to my side.
This page is about a Resort in Maldives. 
I've been using "floats" to keep the things straightforward.
It's composed with a simple horizontal navbar in the top. I've been using "hover" in every link / button.
Four sections in the "index" page: Showcase, history, features section using icons from fontawesome and a simple footer.
Two sections in "about" page: About and testimonials, using "border-radius" for images.
Also, I made a form for the "contact" page and I added a few icons.
The main issue that I found was in this last section. The form was so complicated but finally I could found out to center it and finished it up.

See you in the next website of this project.
